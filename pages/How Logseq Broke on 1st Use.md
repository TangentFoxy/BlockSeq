- Dismiss the warning about re-indexing because I can't find where the button is and the warning is blocking part of the UI.

- Restart Logseq because I can't figure out what's going on.

- There are no errors, and my text is now in a renamed Journal entry, so I assume it's fine.
  logseq.order-list-type:: number
- Suddenly, there's a 2nd Journal entry with the old file name. Out of curiousity, I type into both to see if it saves text in both.
  logseq.order-list-type:: number
- I finally find the re-index button. I decide to look at what's saved on disk due to the warning it shows.
  logseq.order-list-type:: number
- On disk, the text on the 1st entry (what I first typed) is there.
  logseq.order-list-type:: number
- I copy the text from the 2nd entry to my clipboard (the one with the wrong name), since it will be erased according to the warning on re-indexing.
  logseq.order-list-type:: number
- I click the re-indexing button.
  logseq.order-list-type:: number
- Now the text (that was not saved to disk) that I just copied from the 2nd incorrectly named Journal entry is in the 1st correctly named Journal entry (the entry that was on disk), and the 2nd unsaved incorrectly named Journal entry is gone - along with all text that WAS saved to disk in the 1st entry.
