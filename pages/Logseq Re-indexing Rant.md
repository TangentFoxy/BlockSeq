- This is all in response to [How do I re-index? #7825](https://github.com/logseq/logseq/discussions/7825) after getting lost while trying to start understanding Logseq:
- ---
- When Googling the error "logseq you must re-index your graph for this change to take effect", this discussion is the first thing in results, which, while indirectly linking to which button to click in the UI, doesn't actually explain what's going on at all.
- This is a really bad way to greet new users, especially when immediately after this message appears, it blocks another part of the UI I'm trying to understand, leading me to close the message while trying to figure out other things. Also, because I can just dismiss the message which is of critical importance, it means I'm misled into thinking I'm in a stable state when apparently I'm not?
- Because I don't know what this is, or why this manual step is needed <!--for something the program should handle automatically-->, I've now made a bunch of edits, and now that I find out what it really means, I see that a lot of what I've typed in will now be deleted when I re-index, amd also the program isn't actually saving my edits to file right now, which is very confusing. <!--I'm left wondering what the hell is even going on?-->
- Why is graph being used as a noun for all notes (as far as I can tell) while also being used to mean a visual graph? Why does the visual graph show nothing despite me entering text? On a different computer I was briefly trying to understand this program and created multiple pages, but still the graph shows nothing even though orphans should appear (I checked the Nodes settings).
- I'm also curious why it made *two* entries automatically, both with today's date but one with the new format and one with the old format?

- For context of the text currently in that screenshot: The upper note had 3 lines of text on it before changing the date format. After restarting the program because I couldn't figure out how to make it re-index, I had two entries, which I couldn't interact with for a while. Suddenly they both became editable, so I started writing down questions as I tried to understand what is going on here. (Why does it not warn you about needing to re-index after a restart? That's really misleading. As far as I can tell without digging into the files myself, everything is being saved - but it isn't!)
- After reading the warning from clicking the re-index button, I see that everything in the 1st half will be preserved (as it is in the Markdown file created by the program already), but the 2nd half will be completely erased?! It seems *wild* to me that this is expected behavior.
- Also in the same menu as Re-index, there's "Refresh" which says "Import changes from local files". This also sounds like it will destroy the notes I've written down so far that aren't saved? What's the difference between Refresh and Re-index? The UI does not make it clear at all what the difference is.
- ---
- I just think it's kinda crazy that the new-user experience doesn't explain any of this, and apparently it was this confusing 2 years ago. What has changed? Why is it still like this for someone who has no idea what/how this program is supposed to work?
  <!--Why does it ignore tasks put in in Markdown format when the default format is Markdown and I used the task syntax correctly. I tried it both by just adding brackets since it defaults to everything being in a list *and* tried `- [ ]`.-->
- (The note about Zotero is because I clicked on it trying to figure out how to disable or remove it, but it seems like there isn't a way to? So now there's a default profile that I didn't want.)

- Immediately after publishing that comment, I made a backup copy of all text I'd entered so far and Re-indexed. While the warning message says it will pull data from disk and discard what hasn't been saved, it did the exact opposite, deleting everything that had been saved to disk and keeping only what wasn't in the output file already..

  > I clicked the Re-index button, and while the warning message says it will refresh **FROM DISK** and I will lose unsaved changes, it deleted **EVERYTHING THAT WAS ALREADY IN A MARKDOWN FILE ON DISK** and only kept the part that *wasn't saved*. Why does it tell the user it will do the *exact opposite* of what it does?
